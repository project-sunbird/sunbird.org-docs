  description: |-
    The D.I.A.L Code (Digital Infrastructure for Augmented Learning) API resources are used for energising the textbooks.
     - D.I.A.L code allows textbook creators to tag various pages and topics in a flexible manner using the DIAL codes (in QR code format) and these codes can be linked with digital content, thus providing easy access for the end users and a seamless physical to digital transition.
     - The URL for D.I.A.L code API(s) is `dialcode/v1`
