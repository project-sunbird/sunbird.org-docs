  description: "The Location management API resource is used to manage the the physical\
    \ location data of the following: \n  \n  - Users\n  - Organization\n\nOn the\
    \ basis of the data captured using this API resource, the location data helps\
    \ in grouping the users based on the location attribute.\n\nThe URL for Location\
    \ Management API(s) is `data/v1/location`\n\n**Note:** The parent location entity\
    \ used as parent code parameter represents the physical location (X) of a large\
    \ physical area, and incorporates locations of other smaller areas (Y). Similarly\
    \ location entity (Y) may incorporate futher smaller areas(Z) in each location\
    \ entity of (Y).   \n   \n   - You can say entity (X) is superset of location\
    \ entities in (Y). The (Y) location entity is the superset of location entities\
    \ in (Z). Also that (X), (Y) may have \"n\" number of \"Y\",\"Z\" entities respectively.\
    \  \n \n The location management API resources enables you to perform the following\
    \ operations:\n  - create\n  - update\n  - search "
