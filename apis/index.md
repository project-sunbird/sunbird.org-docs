Welcome to Sunbird API reference documentation!

Sunbird is built using microservices as building blocks that are mapped to building block types.
A microservice is defined as 'a **logical unit** of software functionality exposed via a set of **versioned APIs** with well **defined contract**'. Microservices are specific and with a fixed purpose, highly maintainable and testable, independently deployable and organized around functional units. A set of microservices are used to provide a solution.
The definition, it can be explained in detail as follows
- A **logical unit** of work is that which generates value for a user. E.g. The *Content and Collection* microservice is responsible for the lifecycle of content, collections, and assets on the platform.
- An **Application Programming Interface (API)** is a computing tool (web service, UI component) that implements a set of rules. E.g.*Create Content* is an API within the Content Management microservice. The APIs are enhanced as required with each release and hence there are versions of the API. Sunbird APIs are REST based (JSON over HTTPS), Stateless, and Versioned.
- The API endpoints follow a common URL structure, viz; https://{host:port}/{module}/{version}/{api_name}
- The contract of an API consists of a well defined input, output, a set of test cases, along with usage and compatibility rules. Every API has a contract.

This page details Sunbird's building block types, the microservices grouped under each building block type and the APIs for each set of microservice.

## Contribution & Curation

In the **Contribution and Curation**  building block type, Sunbird has microservices to manage the lifecycle of content and collections; create and manage questions and question sets that are useful to assess proficiency of learners; contribution management and contributor registry.

### Content Service {#content-service}
