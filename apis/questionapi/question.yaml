  description: >-
    The Question Management APIs allow you to manage all operations related to Questions and Question Sets over the Sunbird platform.  
    Each endpoint serves a different purpose. Hence, you may choose to use the one that suits your need. These APIs allow you to
    perform the standard CRUD (Create, Update, Read and Delete) operations, and others such as review, publish, reject, etc. 

    - The URL for Sunbird Question API(s) is `question/v1` and `questionset/v1`
