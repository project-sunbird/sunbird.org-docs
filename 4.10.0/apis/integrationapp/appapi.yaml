  title: Sunbird Integration App API(s)
  description: >-
    With the Sunbird mobile app supporting thrid party app integrations, it is required that the third party apps "register" themselves with the Sunbird implementor's app. 
    **The API allows:**
    - whitelisting apps that are recommended by the Sunbird implementor's app to extend the current experience
    - custom UX and labels on the Sunbird implementor's app based by the "registered" third party app
    
    The Integration App API allows you to manage and integrate third party apps for feature extension (OR) feature integration of the Sunbird application. 

    - Each endpoint serves a different purpose. So, you need to use the endpoint depending on what you want to do

    - The integration app registered by the Admin and only the Read API is accessble from the public path.

    - The URL for Sunbird Integration App API(s) is `app/v1`
