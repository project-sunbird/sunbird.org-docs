## Overview
Any content published on Sunbird undergoes a review to ensure that published content adheres to defined guidelines and standards set by the organization. Each organization can set guidelines based on their organization standards. Sunbird provides the feature of configuring review checklist. Any adopter can use this feature and configure checklists for the review process. A content reviewer on Sunbird can perform the following activities: 
<br>&emsp;a) Request changes in the content submitted for review
<br>&emsp;b) Publish the content submitted for review

Currently, before a content is published, the reviewer validates the content with a pre-defined checklist. This checklist can be configured based on organization requirements. This page details the procedure on how to configure the review checklist. Configurations are supported at the following two levels:
<br>&emsp;a) Instance level
<br>&emsp;b) Channel level

When configuration is done at a channel level, it overrides instance level configuration. 

> Note: Configurations are set internally, users can override default configuration to customize checklists for organizational requirements.

Different configuration can be defined differently for the following content types:
* Course
* Textbook
* Resource and Collection

## UI Display with Default Configurations
The UI display, when there are no configurations set for the checklist, is as described:
<br>1. When requesting changes to content, an information message <b>Please detail the required changes in the comments</b> is displayed over the comment box. On entering comments here, the <b>Request Changes</b> button is enabled
<br>2. When publishing reviewed content, a confirmation message <b>Are you sure you want to publish?</b> is displayed. The <b>Publish</b> button is enabled and reviewer clicks the button to publish content

## UI Display with Customized Configurations 
The UI display, when configurations are set for the checklist, is as described:
<br>1. When requesting changes to content, the configured checklist is displayed with a comment box. The reviewer must select atleast one checkbox and provide comments in the comment box to enable <b>Request Changes</b> button 
<br>2. When publishing reviewed content, the configured checklist is displayed with a comment box. The reviewer must select atleast one checkbox to enable <b>Publish</b> button
<br>3. In case of any system failure, when requesting changes to content or when publishing reviewed content, an error message <b>.Something went wrong. Please try again later</b> is displayed
