  curl -X POST \   <your-sunbird-base-url>/api/api-manager/v1/consumer/mobile_app/credential/register \
       -H 'authorization: Bearer <mobile_admin_jwt_token_from_apis_log_file>' \
       -H 'content-type: application/json' \
       -d '{
       "request": {
         "key": "<implementation-name>-mobile-app-<version-number>"
       }
     }'

**Response body:** 

{"result":{"key":"<implementation-name>-mobile-app-<version-number>","secret":"<secret>"}} 

Use the  key and secret from the response given for MOBILE_APP_KEY and MOBILE_APP_SECRET configuration in respective environments in gradle.properties file. Example:

**dev_mobile_app_key = "<implementation-name>-mobile-app-<version-number>"
dev_mobile_app_secret = "<secret>"**
