## Introduction

The Sunbird Mobile app provides mobility to its feature-rich learning platform. It provides learners with the flexibility to learn anywhere, anytime.

## Prerequisites
<br>1.To set up Sunbird mobile app, ensure you have installed the following:
<br>&emsp;a) NPM Version - 3.8.+
<br>&emsp;b) Node JS Version -  6.+
<br>&emsp;c) Cordova Version - 8.0.0
<br>&emsp;d) Ionic Version - 3.20.0
<br>2. Generate the key and secret for the mobile app user using the JWT token of the mobile admin user. Run the **OnboardConsumers** Jenkins Job and take the jwt token(**JWT token for mobile_admin**) from Jenkins Output.

**Generating Secret:**
Execute the listed API to generate the key and secret for the mobile app:

  curl -X POST \   <your-sunbird-base-url>/api/api-manager/v1/consumer/mobile_app/credential/register \
       -H 'authorization: Bearer `<mobile_admin_jwt_token_from_jenkins_job_output>`' \
       -H 'content-type: application/json' \
       -d '{
       "request": {
         "key": "`<implementation-name>`-mobile-app-`<version-number>`"
       }
     }'

**Response body:** 

{"result":{"key":"`<implementation-name>`-mobile-app-`<version-number>`","secret":"`<secret>`"}} 

Use the  key and secret from the response given for MOBILE_APP_KEY and MOBILE_APP_SECRET configuration in respective environments in gradle.properties file. Example:

**dev_mobile_app_key = "`<implementation-name>`-mobile-app-`<version-number>`"
dev_mobile_app_secret = "`<secret>`"**

**Producer Key**

Replace the producer id `PRODUCER_ID` for respective environments in sunbird.properties.

**Fabric credentials:**

Replace `release_fabric_api_key` in `sunbird.properties` with your fabric API Key. Create an account in [fabric.io](https://get.fabric.io/) and register in the app to get the API key.

## Build APK from Git Repository
Sunbird mobile app can be built from the main source code which is available at [Sunbird-Ed](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed)/[SunbirdEd-mobile](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-mobile).

Sample properties file is located inside buildConfig folder. This has to be renamed to sunbird.properties and appropriate values should be provided.

## Installing Individual Plugins
Sunbird is an open source, configurable, extendable, modular learning management platform architected for scale and designed to support multiple teaching and learning solutions supporting multiple languages and available for online and offline use. Various plugins are utilized to meet this objective. Adopters can choose and intall plugins to customize the application to suit their business needs. This ection details the procedure for installing inidividual plugins for the mobile application.

- Clone the SunbirdEd-mobile  repo using the following command: 

	git clone [https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-mobile.git](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-mobile.git).
	go to project folder and run **./build.sh**
	**run** ionic cordova platform add android**

 To change the splash screen and splash image, go to SunbirdEd-mobile/resources/android/splash and update the **drawable-ldpi-splash.png**

To update your required splash.png file and SunbirdEd-mobile/resources/android/icon update **drawable-ldpi-icon.png ** to your required **icon.png file ** in resource folder and  run **ionic cordova run android**. This generates the resource files for this platform and splash image and splash screen automatically changes and is added in config.xml file.

**App Name** is in **sunbird.properties**, change the app name to required name

- Run the following command to install this plugin in SunbirdEd-mobile:

    ionic Cordova plugin add [https://github.com/project-sunbird/cordova-plugin-sunbirdsplash.git](https://github.com/project-sunbird/cordova-plugin-sunbirdsplash.git)

This is installed with other npm packages.

### Cordova-plugin-qr-scanner
This is a custom cordova plugin for the QR scanner.

- Run the following command to install this plugin in SunbirdEd-mobile:

    ionic cordova plugin add [https://github.com/project-sunbird/cordova-plugin-qr-scanner.git](https://github.com/project-sunbird/cordova-plugin-qr-scanner.git)

This is installed with other npm packages.

### Installing the Mobile Application

  1.Create a workspace  (i.e Folder Hierarchy ) and clone the Git repositories into this folder

  2.Execute the instructions mentioned for each cloned repository

  3.Open terminal and change the directory to "SunbirdEd-mobile" 

  4.Add one device to the system

  5.Run the command- **$ ionic cordova run android**
  
### Generate Multiple Sunbird Apps
As a Sunbird instance owner, owner  should be able to generate multiple apps for multiple environments(dev/qa/production)
so that user can use all the apps simultaneously.
For each app, user should be able to have different content stores (on the local device), fire telemetry from separate app identifiers and upload to playstore (if need be).
#### Configuration
Instance admin of Sunbird adopters can configure the appId in the following way to acheive the functionality
* dev_app_id = org.sample.app.dev
* staging_app_id = org.sample.app.staging
* production_app_id = org.sample.app
