## Overview
A new user can be created in Sunbird in the following two ways:
- Self sign-up using Sunbird where user can provide email, phone and password during user creation
- Bulk users creation by Organisation Admin where an initial password is not yet set

The Sunbird requires users to either verify email (when user is created by self sign-up) or set password (when users are created by bulk upload) for the first time before they are able to log in to Sunbird.

The verify email or set password link is sent to the newly created users via email and/or SMS. The generated link also consists of a redirect URI to which the user is redirected after completing the required action.

This document explains the configuration required in Keycloak to generate links for the required action to be performed by a new user.

## Configure Environment Variables

Following environment variables need to be configured in Sunbird LMS service for generating required action links:

- sunbird_sso_url
- sunbird_sso_username
- sunbird_sso_password
- sunbird_sso_realm
- sunbird_sso_client_id
- sunbird_url_shortner_enable
- sunbird_url_shortner_access_token
- sunbird_keycloak_required_action_link_expiration_seconds

> Note: For details on the environment variables, refer to [Sunbird LMS Service Environment Variables](http://docs.sunbird.org/latest/developer-docs/configuring_sunbird/env_variables_lms/).
