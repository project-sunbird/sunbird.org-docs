## Introduction

The Sunbird Mobile app provides mobility to its feature-rich learning platform. It provides learners with the flexibility to learn anywhere, anytime.

## Prerequisites
1.To set up Sunbird mobile app, ensure you have installed the following:
  
  - NPM Version - 3.5.2
  - Node JS Version - above 6  
  - Cordova Version - 8.0.0
  - Ionic Version - 3.20.0
  
2.Generate the key and secret for the mobile app user using the JWT token of the mobile admin user. The JWT token for mobile admin user is printed on the application:
 *server folder /where-you-cloned-sunbird-devops-repo/sunbird-devops/deploy/logs/apis.log.*

**Generating Secret:**
Execute the listed API to generate the key and secret for the mobile app:

  curl -X POST \ &#60;your-sunbird-base-url&#62;/api/api-manager/v1/consumer/mobile_app/credential/register \
       -H 'authorization: Bearer &#60;mobile_admin_jwt_token_from_apis_log_file&#62;' \
       -H 'content-type: application/json' \
       -d '{
       "request": {
         "key": "&#60;implementation-name&#62;-mobile-app-&#60;version-number&#62;"
       }
     }'

**Response body:** 

    {"result":{"key":"&#60;implementation-name&#62;-mobile-app-&#60;version-number&#62;","secret":"&#60;secret&#62;"}} 

    Use the  key and secret from the response given for MOBILE_APP_KEY and MOBILE_APP_SECRET configuration in respective environments in gradle.properties file. Example:

    dev_mobile_app_key = "&#60;implementation-name&#62;-mobile-app-&#60;version-number&#62;"
    dev_mobile_app_secret = "&#60;secret&#62;"

**Producer Key**

Replace the producer id `PRODUCER_ID` for respective environments in the **sunbird.properties** file.

**Fabric credentials:**

Replace `release_fabric_api_key` in `sunbird.properties` with your fabric API Key. Create an account in [fabric.io](https://get.fabric.io/) and register in the app to get the API key.

## Build APK from Git Repository

Build the Sunbird mobile app from the main source code that is available at [project-sunbird](https://github.com/project-sunbird)/[sunbird-mobile](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-mobile).

### Installing the Mobile Application

  1.Create a workspace (Folder Hierarchy) and clone the Git repositories into this folder

  2.Execute the instructions mentioned for each cloned repository

  3.Open terminal and change the directory to "sunbird-mobile" 

  4.Add one device to the system

  5.Run the command- **$ ionic cordova run android**
  
### Generate Multiple Sunbird Apps
As a Sunbird instance owner, owner  should be able to generate multiple apps for multiple environments(dev/qa/production)
so that user can use all the apps simultaneously.
For each app, user should be able to have different content stores (on the local device), fire telemetry from separate app identifiers and upload to playstore (if need be).

#### Configuration
Instance admin of Sunbird adopters can configure the appId in the following way to acheive the functionality
* dev_app_id = org.sample.app.dev
* staging_app_id = org.sample.app.staging
* production_app_id = org.sample.app
