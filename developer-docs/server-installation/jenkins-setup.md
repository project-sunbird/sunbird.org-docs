## Jenkins Setup

Jenkins is used to build, deploy and setup the infrastructure for Sunbird. Almost everything in Sunbird is automated using Jenkins pipelines which integrates with ansible and other tools.

- SSH to the Jenkins server and enter the following commands -

     ```bash
    - git clone https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops.git
    - cd sunbird-devops && git checkout tags/release-3.8.0_RC14 -b release-3.8.0_RC14
    - cd deploy/jenkins
    - sudo bash jenkins-server-setup.sh
     ```

- Open Jenkins UI in a browser by visiting **JENKINS_IP:8080**

- Enter the initial password and follow the on-screen instructions. Choose **Install suggested plugin** and create an admin user

- Run the below commands on Jenkins server -

    ```bash
    sudo bash jenkins-plugins-setup.sh
    cp envOrder.txt.sample envOrder.txt
    vi envOrder.txt
    ```

- Update the environment list as per your requirement in ascending order. For example, if you want to have dev, staging and production environments, your **envOrder.txt** will look like -

    ```bash
    dev=0
    staging=1
    production=2
    ```

- Run the below script on Jenkins server and provide input as required (case sensitive) -

    ```bash
    sudo bash jenkins-jobs-setup.sh
    ```

- Restart jenkins

    ```bash
    sudo service jenkins restart
    ```

- Add a credential in Jenkins and choose **_Username with Password_** from the drop down. Enter the username and password of the private github repository. Enter a unique value for the **ID** field like **_private-repo-creds_**

- Go to **Manage Jenkins** -> **Configure System** -> **Environment Variables** and add the following variables

    |**Name**|**Value**|
    |---|---|
    |**ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR**|`true`|
    |**ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING**|`false`|
    |**ANSIBLE_STDOUT_CALLBACK**|`debug`|
    |**hub_org**|docker hub organization / username. Example: In `docker pull sunbird/ubuntu:20.04`, the hub_org is `sunbird`|
    |**private_repo_branch**|private repo branch name where ansible inventory is present|
    |**private_repo_credentials**|the unique value which you provided for **ID** field while adding the credentials|
    |**private_repo_url**|The **https** github url of your private repo| 
    |**public_repo_branch**|`release-3.8.0`|
    |**override_private_branch**|`true`|
    |**override_public_branch**|`true`|
    |**java11_home**|`/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/`|

- Scroll down to the **Global Pipeline Libraries** section and click on **Add**. Provide the values as below:

    |**Name**|**Value**|
    |-------|--------|
    |**Library Name**|`deploy-conf`|
    |**Default version**|`shared-lib`
    |**Retrieval method**|Modern SCM|
    |**Source Code Management**|`Git`|
    |**Project Repository**|`https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops.git`|

- Click **Save** and go to **Manage Jenkins** -> **Configure global security**

- Choose the **Markup Formatter** as **Safe HTML** and Under **Copy Artifact Compatibility mode**  choose **Migration**

- Go to **Manage Jenkins** -> **Manage Nodes** -> Click **master** -> Click **Configure** -> Provide **labels**. Provide the label as `build-slave ops-slave`

- Update the number of executors (`cpu cores x 2 = number of executors`)

- Run the below commands on Jenkins server -

    ```bash
    sudo su jenkins
    mkdir -p /var/lib/jenkins/secrets
    cd /var/lib/jenkins/secrets
    touch deployer_ssh_key vault-pass k8s.yaml
    chmod 400 deployer_ssh_key vault-pass k8s.yaml
    ```

- Copy the contents of your server's private key into `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/deployer_ssh_key`  

- Copy the kubernetes config file contents into `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/k8s.yaml`

- If you have encrypted your `secrets.yml` using `ansible-vault`, enter the password to decrypt into `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/vault-pass`. If you have not encrypted, then enter a random value like **12345**

- Run `sudo visudo` on jenkins server and add the below line -

 ```bash
    jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
 ```

- Reboot the Jenkins VM (`sudo reboot`)
