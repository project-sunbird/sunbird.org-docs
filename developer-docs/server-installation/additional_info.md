## Sunbird Install Script 

The Sunbird installation script `./sunbird_install.sh` is a wrapper shell script that invokes other scripts or Ansible playbooks. It fetches all the docker images from the Sunbird DockerHub repository. 

* `sanity.sh` - Basic Sunbird prerequisites check. 

* `install-deps.sh` - Installs Ansible v2.4.1.0 on the installation server to provision and deploy Sunbird. This script also sets up the docker swarm.

* `generate_config.sh` - Creates a workspace for the installation and sets up necessary config files. 

* `generate_hosts.sh` - Creates a hosts file (Ansible file format) dynamically to run the Ansible scripts.   

* `install-dbs.sh` - Installs Cassandra, Elasticsearch and Postgres databases.

* `init-dbs.sh` - Sets up the required schema for Cassandra, Elasticsearch and Postgres databases.

* `deploy-apis.sh` - Deploys the api gateway (Kong) as a docker service using Ansible. 

* `deploy-proxy.sh` - Deploys the proxy (Nginx) as a docker service.

* `provision-keycloak.sh` - Installs Keycloak.

* `deploy-keycloak-vm.sh` - Deploys the OAuth service (Keycloak) on the VM. The Keycloak service runs outside the swarm.

* `bootstrap-keycloak.sh` - Imports the auth realm and configures Keycloak.

* `deploy-badger.sh` - Deploys the badger service as docker service.

* `deploy-core.sh` - Deploys the core services player, content, actor and learner service as docker services. The content, actor and learner service together form the LMS backend.
