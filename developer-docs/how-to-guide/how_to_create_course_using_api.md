## Scenario

XYZ Corporation, is a global conglomerate that works in the domain of education and collaborates with different institutions, NGOs and academicians around the world. The organization has adopted Sunbird to cater to evolving training needs to amplify learning opportunities. The organization has provided open access to its existing content assets. The organization also offers certification courses to candidates. 

## Prerequisites

1. API Key to access Sunbird APIs. To create an API key refer to [How to generate a Sunbird API key](developer-doc/how-to-guide/generate_apikey)

2. An API client to make API calls. For instance curl or POSTMAN. For details on using postman refer [Using Postman](http://www.sunbird.org/apis/framework/#tag/usingpostman)

3. Access to the [Content API](http://docs.sunbird.org/latest/apis/content/)

4. Content should be created and available 

## Taskflow

The content on Sunbird can be created using [Inbuilt Content Editor](http://docs.sunbird.org/latest/features-documentation/contenteditor/) as well as through APIs. Content in sunbird can be of different types:

1. Courses

2. Collections

3. Resources

4. Lesson Plan
