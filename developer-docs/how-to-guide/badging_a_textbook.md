## Scenario

XYZ Corp is a global conglomerate with over ten thousand employees, spread across 7 locations. The organization required to create content, book and segregate the content for a different purpose. They can do so using Sunbird portal, they can even mark/badge those books with a different tag such as official,  editor’s pick, recommended and so on as required. In that case, when the users of the organization log into Sunbird, they can view the badged book distinguishably. The badge name is visible beside those textbooks that are already badges by badge issuers. Here, we will describe the workflow of assigning a badge to a textbook.

## Overview

Badges represent an award, a certificate, an endorsement or an authorization. As part of a learning platform, badging is an important concept that is highly useful for different users such as teachers, students, content and course creators, mentors, content authors and so on. It also plays a critical role in the curation of content and courses On Sunbird; there are two types of badges: 

1. Badges for Content 

2. Badges for People

Here we are discussing Badging content or book. Once an organization create/compile, and upload books on Sunbird portal, They can even mark/badge those books with a different tag such as Official,  Editor’s pick, Recommended and so on. In that case, when the users of the organization log into Sunbird, they can view the badged book distinguishably. The badge name is visible beside those textbooks that are already badges by badge issuers.

## Use case

Badging content (book) provides the benefits such as content usage, content effectiveness, and content segregation.

1. Organizations can create authorized content on Sunbird and mark them with appropriate badges such as Official. During search or navigation, badged content is displayed in the top results 

2. Organizations can create content for specific use cases such as content for special needs, specific age groups and so on. Badging such content aids their discoverability.

3. Endorse books with badges such as popular, favorite, recommended to increase the effectiveness and usability

This document describes prerequisite for badging a textbook and steps to badge a book.

## The task flow for Assigning a Badge to a Book

You need to design and develop badging as a framework to make it extensible and support multiple use cases. Currently, you need to create badges on the platform only through the backend, by using API. Issuing of the Official badge to Textbooks can be performed through Sunbird user interface and API as well. After assigning a badge to a book, the badge is viewed on the portal beside the book.

To complete this scenario, the admin creates badges and assign a badge issuer role. The badge issuer can assign the badge to book using APIs.

<b>Assigning Badge to a Textbook Using API</b>:

This API is associated with badge assertion that means badging a textbook or user.

* **_/badge/assertion/create_** endpoint executes the Create Badge Assertions request based on parameters provided as metadata in the request body

* It is mandatory to provide values for parameters

* Mandatory fields cannot be null or empty
